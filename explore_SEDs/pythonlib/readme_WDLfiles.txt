WDL_theanofull.py is the true final version with EVERYTHING in there.

WDL_theano.py is the lightened version you made for Shuyu Dong a while back, and should do everything that's in there right.

WDL_lite.py should be pretty close to WDL_theano.py (ie. lots of useless/deprecated stuff removed to make Theano compilation faster) though you made this one for yourself ages ago and barely tested it at all (though yeah, you did run your bimodal application using it)
